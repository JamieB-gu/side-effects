# Side Effects

An experiment in state management and side effects with React. The app code that manages state and side effects lives in `src/app.ts`. Also included is a `demo.tsx` file that demonstrates how this can be used in an application.

## Install

Clone the repo, then install dependencies with:

```sh
npm install
```

## Run

```sh
npm run dev-server
```

Go to `localhost:9000` in a browser.

## Future Plans

- Integrate state updates with React's state lifecycle, to improve render performance.
